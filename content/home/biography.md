Hello! I'm Naren, a Data Science Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://ds.njit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://people.njit.edu/profile/geller" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. James Geller</a> and <a href="https://people.njit.edu/profile/lw29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Lijing Wang</a>. My research lies in the domain of Biomedical ontologies, with a focus primarily on Incremental Ontology Expansion and Concept Goodness. Alongside my research, I am an Adjunct Instructor teaching <a href="https://digitalcommons.njit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1485&context=cs-syllabi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Database System Design and Management (CS 331)</a> and a Teaching Assistant for graduate level courses.

Before moving to Biomedical Ontologies, I explored the domain of Parallel and High Performance Computing as a Graduate Researcher at NJIT. My professional journey also took me to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes Media LLC</a> during the Summer of 2022. As a Technology Engineering Intern at Forbes, I collaborated with the Platform & Product Engineering Team, significantly enhancing their Content Management System and initiating the development of the new Mobile Application for Forbes Daily Dozen Newsletter.

Apart from my academic commitments, I am a <a href="https://githubcampus.expert/narenkhatwani/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Campus Expert</a>, where I build diverse and inclusive communities to learn skills, collaborate on projects, and share experiences. Through this platform, I introduce students to promising research domains and organize collaborative events in partnership with GitHub, Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) - NJIT chapter & Graduate Women in Computing (GWiCS) focusing on open-source learning and innovation.
