    description: GitHub Campus Experts are student leaders that strive to build diverse and inclusive communities to learn skills collaborate on projects, and share their experiences. The community I have been working to develop is known as the NJIT HPC Initiative. Our main goal is to make students aware of High-Performance Computing as a viable research domain and remove its fear from the mind of students.
